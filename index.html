                    <b>Welcome!</b> <br />Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
                    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
                    printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not
                    only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
                    It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
                    and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
                    Ipsum. Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has
                    roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard
                    McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more
                    obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the
                    word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
                    1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
                    written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
                    Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in
                    section 1.10.32.There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority
                    have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even
                    slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there
                    isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the
                    Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the
                    Internet.It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a
                    page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
                    distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like
                    readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their
                    default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their
                    infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose
                    (injected humour and the like).

                <b>Leftcolum: <em>230px</em></b> <br> orem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used
                in laying out print, graphic or web
                designs. The passage is attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th century who is thought to have
                scrambled parts of Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum for use in a type specimen book. It usually
                begins with:

                “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et
                dolore magna aliqua.”
                The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text (sentence, paragraph, page,
                etc.) that doesn't distract from the layout. A practice not without controversy, laying out pages with
                meaningless filler text can be very useful when the focus is meant to be on design, not content.

                <b>Rightcolum : <em>230px</em></b> <br> The placeholder text, beginning with the line “Lorem ipsum dolor
                sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit”,
                looks like Latin because in its youth, centuries ago, it was Latin.

                Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar from Hampden-Sydney College, is credited with discovering the source
                behind the ubiquitous filler text. In seeing a sample of lorem ipsum, his interest was piqued by
                consectetur—a genuine, albeit rare, Latin word. Consulting a Latin dictionary led McClintock to a
                passage from De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (“On the Extremes of Good and Evil”), a first-century B.C.
                text from the Roman philosopher Cicero.

                In particular, the garbled words of lorem ipsum bear an unmistakable resemblance to sections 1.10.32–33
                of Cicero's work, with the most notable passage excerpted below:
